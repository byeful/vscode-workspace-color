# Workspace Color

The extension allows you to set unique color per each **Workspace Folder**.

## Usage

- Open a ```Workspace```.
- Set your own colors per each **Workspace Folder** by ```Workspace Color: Change Color``` in the **Command Palette**.
- Editor's ```Title Bar``` has to be changed to the selected color assigned to workspace folder or to the random one if it hasn't been selected yet.

## Known issues

- The ```Title Bar``` color doesn't change to default in folders which are out of any workspace.
