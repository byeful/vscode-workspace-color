# Workspace Color

Change an editor's color depending on the active folder in workspace.

## Usage

* Open workspace.
* Change files between different folders in the workspace.
* Look at title bar color - it has to be changed to a random color which assigned to a folder on extension's startup.

## Known issues

* Can't choose own colors instead of random.
* Colors for folders changes every time editor starts up.
* The title bar color doesn't change to default in folder with no workspace.
* Poor usage instruction without pictures.
